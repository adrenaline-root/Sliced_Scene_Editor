# SlicedSceneEditor

The main goal of this project is to create a program that is able to achieve the creation of scenes based on the sprite stacking technique, and for that, it uses tilesets of previously created sprites under this very technique.

As tilesets intended, sprites works here as blocks, and combining them with each other (as mayority of 2D pixel games use to do) can result in a pretty diverse group of diferent objects, that under the hook of the stacking (in difference with 2D pixel games) allows to manipulate them in order to achieve some interesting 3D effects.

The tilesets are a compound of just pure color layers(the color of the object itself) and the normals layers(the colors that represents the normal on every pixel in the surface of the object). And with that and a bit of work on OpenGl, here is some of the results:
